# Emacs Init Script

Initiates Emacs configurations all from a single file. This includes:
* All extensions
* Keybinds
* Custom commands
* Emacs command overrides
* Emacs configurations

> NOTE: I am not using Emacs for a long time now. Even though I switched to Vim and "vim extensions" for other editors, Emacs is still the most powerful editor IMO. But when you reach the time when you spend an hour setting up the environment for you half an hour project, you just need get over Emacs.
